            <p>Hi, I am a Front-end deverloper based in Freising, Germany.
                My passion for web development started 2021 when 
                I discovered the incredible power of creating interactive and 
                visually appealing websites. Since then, I have dedicated 
                myself to honing my skills and staying up-to-date with the 
                latest trends and technologies in the ever-evolving world of web development.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows 
                    me to transform design concepts into fully functional and responsive 
                    websites. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and ensuring 
                    that the user experience is seamless across different devices and browsers.</p>

                <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a creative thinker and problem solver. 
                    I enjoy finding innovative solutions to challenges and continuously improving 
                    the functionality and aesthetics of websites. I have a keen eye for design and 
                    strive to create visually engaging interfaces that captivate users and enhance 
                    their overall browsing experience.</p>
